Programmatic access API endpoints

<p>         Welcome to the interactive documentation page for the         AlphaFold Protein Structure Database Application Programming Interface (API).         The API provides a convenient and efficient way for developers to         programmatically access  metadata related to all the archived AlphaFold         predictions.         </p>         <p>         With this API, you can easily retrieve information about protein structures         predicted by AlphaFold, such as URLs to model files (mmCIF, bCIF and PDB),         models quality estimates, and other useful information. All the API endpoints         are keyed on UniProt accessions. The API is designed to be easy to integrate         into your own software, and we provide documentation and code examples         below to help you get started.</p>
